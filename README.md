Basically this is it.  I am going to change a few things with the astehtics of the project but thats not what we are here for.
More interested in the errors and the problems/inconsistancies that are present.  
I also can't really do anything if you give me a testing document the day before the project is due so please try to have them back
to me and saul by sunday.
